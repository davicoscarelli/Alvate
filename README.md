# Alvate

Alvate aims to tackle the rising anxiety and intimacy problems amongst teens by using AI to create positive reinforcement in the day-to-day experience and thoughts of the users. The product, a personal motivation video generator, takes short day-to-day commentary from the user and a video of a person speaking and generates a video of the person giving the user a positive reinforcement comment. Our goal is to provide users a comforting words from a comforting face and increase their mood/motivation.



This repository contains the core processing for the product, inputting a resume of how the user is feeling, and having as output Neil deGrasse Tyson saying an uplifting comment (if you want another avatar you can save a short video of someone talking in the root folder under the name of `video.mp4`). 

The code is based on the implementation of the following papers:
